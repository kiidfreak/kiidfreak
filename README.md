# 🚀 Current 2025 Roadmap: Quant Finance + ZK-Proofs Mastery

This repo is my public commitment: by **December 2025**, I will understand and *apply* both  
- **Quantitative Finance (stochastic processes, risk, modeling)**  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, cryptographic protocols)**  

so I can fuse them into real blockchain + trading applications.  

---

## 🎯 Core Goals
1. Build strong foundations in **probability, stochastic calculus, and risk concepts**.  
2. Learn the **algebra + finite field math** that underpins zk-proofs.  
3. Implement at least **one mini zk-app** (proof-of-funds or private voting).  
4. Publish **2–3 GitHub projects** blending quant + crypto.  

---

## 📆 Month-by-Month Plan

### **September 2025 – Groundwork**
- 📖 MIT Quant Finance Lectures (playlist) – focus on **probability, regression, risk basics**  
- 📘 Text: *Probability for Finance* (Sheldon Ross / Shreve notes optional)  
- 🧮 Exercises: probability distributions, conditional expectation  
- 🛠️ Project: Repo setup → `notes/`, `exercises/`, `summaries/` folders  

---

### **October 2025 – Bridge Math**
- 📖 Topics: **Linear Algebra review**, **Finite Fields**, **Group Theory**  
- 📘 Text: *A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra* (Victor Shoup)  
- 🛠️ Code mini-labs: implement finite field operations in Python  
- ✍️ Write blog #1: “Why zk-proofs need algebra (explained for builders)”  

---

### **November 2025 – Cryptography Core**
- 📖 Study zk-SNARK primer + ZK-STARK overview (Vitalik, Ariel Gabizon, StarkWare papers)  
- 📘 Resource: *Zero-Knowledge Proofs: An Illustrated Primer* (Matthew Green blog + papers)  
- 🛠️ Hands-on:  
  - Build **zk-proof toy example** using Circom or Halo2  
  - Explore a private “proof of funds” circuit  
- ✍️ Blog #2: “From fields to proofs: building my first zk-circuit”  

---

### **December 2025 – Integration + Showcase**
- 🎯 Goal: Merge **quant + zk** in one demonstrator project.  
- Example ideas:  
  - **Private risk model**: prove your portfolio VaR without revealing positions.  
  - **Fair trading bot log**: zk-proof that trades followed risk limits.  
- 🛠️ Deliverables:  
  - `project-final/` repo with full code + README  
  - Final write-up: “Quant + ZK: Lessons from my 2025 roadmap”  
- ✍️ Blog #3: Year-in-review on Medium + GitHub  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Resources
- Languages: Python (finance), Rust/Solidity (zk & blockchain)  
- Frameworks: Circom, Halo2, Scroll zkEVM testnet  
- References: MIT OCW, Shoup’s book, Shreve’s *Stochastic Finance*  

---

## ✅ Accountability
- Weekly GitHub commits (notes, code, summaries).  
- Monthly blog posts (3 total).  
- Final zk+quant project shipped in **December 2025**.
